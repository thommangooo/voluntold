- **Member portal:** Fully functional with real database integration
- **Admin dashboard:** Existing system enhanced with new authentication
- **Email system:** Working with verified domain (voluntold.net)
- **Database:** All tables created and functional

## Technical Architecture

### Authentication Strategy (Option B - Role-First)
- **Admin Path:** Password required + org selection â†’ admin dashboard
- **Member Path:** Magic link only + org selection â†’ member portal
- Clean separation prevents authentication confusion

### Database Schema Key Points
```sql
-- Members can belong to multiple orgs (different user_profiles records)
user_profiles (id, tenant_id, email, first_name, last_name, role, phone_number, position, address)

-- Volunteer signups
signups (id, opportunity_id, tenant_id, member_email, member_name, status='confirmed')

-- Opportunities with scheduling
opportunities (id, project_id, title, date_scheduled, time_start, duration_hours, volunteers_needed)

-- Additional hours tracking
additional_hours (id, project_id, member_id, hours_worked, date_worked, tenant_id)

-- Polling system
polls (id, tenant_id, title, question, poll_type, status, expires_at)
poll_responses (id, poll_id, member_email, member_name, response, responded_at)

-- NEEDED: Member magic link tokens
member_tokens (id, token, member_email, tenant_id, expires_at, created_at, used_at)
```

### File Structure
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Home page (âœ… completed)
- `src/app/tenant/page.tsx` - Admin dashboard (working)
- `src/app/member/[token]/page.tsx` - Member portal (âœ… structure completed, needs database integration)
- `src/api/member-access` - Magic link generation (needed)
- `src/api/member-auth/[token]` - Token validation (needed)

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. âœ… Magic Link Authentication System - COMPLETED
### 2. âœ… Admin Authentication System - COMPLETED  
### 3. âœ… Security & UX Enhancements - COMPLETED

### 4. Member Opportunity Signup Functionality
**Next major feature to implement:**
- "Sign Up" button functionality on member portal opportunity cards
- Integration with existing signup system from admin dashboard
- Email confirmations for new signups
- Calendar integration for members
- Prevent double-signups and handle capacity limits

### 5. Advanced Features & Polish
**Future enhancements:**
- Enhanced admin dashboard features and reporting
- Member activity tracking and analytics
- Bulk actions for member management
- Advanced polling features and analytics
- Email template customization and branding

### 6. Production Deployment & Testing
**Final phase:**
- Comprehensive end-to-end testing of both authentication flows
- Multi-organization testing with real data
- Performance testing with larger datasets
- Production environment configuration and optimization
- Complete documentation and user guides

## Styling Guidelines
- **Consistent with admin dashboard:** Blue theme (blue-600), white cards with shadows
- **Member-friendly:** Simplified UI, focus on key information
- **Responsive:** Mobile-friendly design
- **Components:** Reuse modal patterns, button styles, form styling

## Development Workflow
- **Full page artifacts** for complete copy-paste implementation
- **Next.js ready** with proper imports and routing
- **Production syntax** with TypeScript interfaces

## Key Technical Decisions Made
1. **Clean architecture:** Separate admin and member authentication flows
2. **Multi-tenant support:** Members can belong to multiple organizations
3. **Token-based member auth:** No passwords for members, magic links only
4. **Member features:** Focus on personal schedule, hours, polls, and roster

**Current Priority:** The core authentication infrastructure is complete! Next focus should be on member opportunity signup functionality to complete the member experience loop.

**Ready for Production:**  
- âœ… Complete dual authentication system (members + admins)
- âœ… Home page with working authentication flows (v32 - syntax error free)
- âœ… Member access API with organization selection and magic links
- âœ… Admin sign-in API with password validation and organization selection  
- âœ… Member portal with token validation and real database integration
- âœ… Database schema for member_tokens table
- âœ… Security best practices with email enumeration protection
- âœ… Professional UX with success screens and user-controlled flows

**Environment Requirements:**
- Supabase database with all tables created
- Resend API key configured
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL environment variable
- Verified domain (voluntold.net) for email sending

**Next Conversation Starter:** "I'd like to continue building Voluntold. We've completed both authentication systems! The member and admin flows are working perfectly. Now let's add [member opportunity signup functionality / advanced features / production deployment preparation]..." [share this artifact]
